# Macros explanation

- EnergyIC : compute and draw the histogram of the energy contain inside a certain volume
- EnergyVSLength : looks at the correlation between, the amount of reconstructed energy, and the length of the reconstruted track
- GetCompletion and GetResolution : test different geometries of the fiducial volume. Both will compute and draw all the useful plots needed to optimize the geometry.
- RecoEnergy_1TS : looks at the energy histogram if we only take the longer track and the most energetic shower
- RecoRslCplVSEnergy : retrieve the optimize value of the resolution and the completion from a file and plot them in term of the energy
- Visualisation : create a visualisation of the reconstructed of simulated data along with the fiducial volume
