Header files:
=============

Analyser.h
----------
 - allows for cuts, gets longest and shortest track, can check if
 Kmu2, would cut on 2 tracks - strict or min, finds direction of the
 long and short tracks as reconstructed (short 1 if points to common
 vertex, long 1 if points away from common vertex), would make cut on
 mu len, does other truth related cuts, checks if calo res range
 reversed or not
 - used in many (maybe all) plotting scripts

EventDisplay.h
---------------
 - creates a window with 3 views, overlaying MC truth trajectory
 points with track hit points
 - used in Scan.C

EventSelector.h
EventSelector_2plane_bestplanecut.h
EventSelector_3plane.h
EventSelector_3plane_bestplanecut.h
EventSelector_Trim.h
---------------
 - looks to be the same as Analyser.h loads in the template
 - min2tracks version finds appropriate pair of tracks
 - used in the script that processes events and generates double LL
 ratios
 - _Trim version in trimTree.C
 - min2tracks version used in all min2tracks scripts

NDKAna_v3.h
-----------
 - don't know... created it at some point because changed the data
 model. But now obsolete as include/NDKAna.h has been updated... I
 think

Processor.h
-----------
 - used in plotRanges.C
 - looks the same as Analyser and EventSelector.C


min2tracks/BDTTree.h
====================
 - the essential header for the BDT analysis
 - defines all the variables to be stored
 - provides methods to create a new tree with them or to register
 an input tree
 - all done in a way that it is easier to inlcude new variables, once
 is enough, the variable is propagated into the event structure, and
 the helper methods!
