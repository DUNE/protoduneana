The data sample:
 * SAM definition:  vpec_NNBarAtm_hA_BR_noCCTaus_dune10kt_1x2x6_reco
 * dunetpc version: v08_37_00
 * event count:     5114000
 * content (words by Josh):
    * based on Honda fluxes at 0.1-100 GeV at the Homestake site at solar max
    * all oscillations are included for nominal best fit values (with taus)
    * no CC nu_tau interactions due to bugs in GEANT that do not polarisation
    * some spectral artifacts persist (e.g. due to energy binning of flux)
 * GENIE version: 3.0.6 (independently from what LArSoft offers)
 * nuclear model: hA Intranuke 2018 and the “default” relativistic nonlocal
   Bodek-Ritchie Fermi gas (this does not matter much to us)
